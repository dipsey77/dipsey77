Create a program that prints a list of words in random order.
# The program should print all the words and not repeat any.

import random

count = 0

new = []

words=("Gold", "Money", "Whealth", "Motor", "Amplify", "Goat", "Boombest")
print("The initial words are: ")
print(words)

while count < len(words):
    r_word = random.choice(words)
    if r_word not in new:
        new.append(r_word)
        count += 1
    else:
        continue
        
    print(r_word)
    input("\npress the enter key")


for i in new:
    print(i, end=" ")

input("\n\nPress enter key to exit")

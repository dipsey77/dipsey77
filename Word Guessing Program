# Word Guessing Program
# Create a game where the computer picks a random word and
# the player has to guess that word. The computer tells the
# player how many letters are in the word. Then the player gets
# five chances to ask if a letter is in the word. The computer can
# only respond with “yes” or “no”. Then, the player must guess
# the word.

# create word library
word_library = ("goal", "money", "rise", "wealthy")
# random selection from word_library
word = random.choice(word_library)
correct = word

no_of_letters = len(correct)

# welcome the player

      You have only five chances to ask if a letter in the word
            to check if a letter is in word, type "ask".

          of letters in the word, I hope you found it now.
